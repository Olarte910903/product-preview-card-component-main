## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (with some problems)



### What I learned

I have learned how to edit the markdown files, and practice a little more my english. I have also practiced with the semantic html tags, since in the previous challenge, some colleagues have recommended it to me and I have tried to apply it in this project, if the html syntax is wrongly written, do not hesitate to help me, so I can learn more.


### Continued development

I want to learn in a more efficient way to layout sites with html and css, that's why I will dedicate myself more in depth in these topics. Since it is a little difficult for me when it comes to layout my projects, because I do not know much about syntactic html and css, I just know the basics, but I want to go deeper into the topics.



### Useful resources

- [lenguajehtml.com](https://lenguajehtml.com/) - This resource helped me to learn html basics.
- [lenguajecss.com](https://lenguajecss.com/) - This resource helped me to learn css basics.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - This resource helped me to learn both, but i dont understand good this page.
